This repository contains the codes and resources for the article “Enhancing Machine Learning Prediction of Biomass Pyrolysis Yields through Taxonomy-Based Preprocessing and Rigorous Model Tuning.”

All materials are openly available. We believe that scientific progress is built on transparency and integrity, and we encourage others to build upon this work.

Usage Notes:
1. MAIN_* scripts are the entry points for model development.
2. SUB_* scripts are supporting subroutines used by the main programs.
3. The programs will process data as long as it follows the format provided in RAW ML.xlsx.
